# COSC247_Geolocation
This code/data was created as a final project for a machine learning course. It takes in fictitious social media user data, including login and posting habit data, as well as friend connection graph data, and uses a linear regression model to predict user location (lat, long).

Questions (corresponding to writeup):


Q0:
1. What is your team name?
2. What is your name, email address, and kaggle username (for both team members)?
3. What is your score on the public leaderboard?


Q1:

How does your system work?
Describe in detail how your predictor makes its predictions.
Also describe why you chose what you did.


Q2.  

If you had this same data, but an extra six months you could dedicate to building the best prediction system you could, what would you do?

Q3. 

If you could get more data from MyFace+ to help infer user location, what would you want and how would you use it?
Focus on data that a company like MyFace+ probably already collects anyway (e.g., login times, post content, number of seconds the user has each individual post on screen (yes, everybody collects this), links clicked, etc.).
